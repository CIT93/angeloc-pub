My dev_1 project is going to involve the type of day in which I could go to the gym and other days in which I can't. I would like to try to involve more elements such as time and the date. Since finding the errors on my original dev I would be looking out for common mistakes like keeping the same showOnPage instead of having two separate errors stopping the whole code from running. With my better understanding with CRUD now hopefully I can stay on track with the updating, removing data, and to make sure I correctly use the arrow functions. The whole purpose of this dev would be for the data to be from the status of the day and the type of day you would like to go to the gym. The data stored inside of the local storage hopefully would be the output and displayed with the refactor functions.
